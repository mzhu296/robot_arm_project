OpenCV Performance and Object Identification:
=============================================

- OpenCV has demonstrated stability and reliable performance in handling real-time camera feeds. The feed operates smoothly without noticeable issues, effectively capturing and encompassing objects within its field of view.

- However, one limitation of OpenCV's object detection is its reliance on predefined classes for identifying objects. 

- This means that for an object to be recognized, it must first be assigned a specific class. 

- During testing, this became evident when I needed to manually define the object classes that OpenCV could detect. 

- As a result, expanding the systemâ€™s recognition capabilities will require the addition of numerous new classes to accommodate different objects.

- While OpenCV provides a solid foundation for object detection, its dependency on predefined classifications may require significant effort if a diverse range of objects needs to be identified. 

- Automating or streamlining the class addition process could be a potential area for improvement in future implementations.
